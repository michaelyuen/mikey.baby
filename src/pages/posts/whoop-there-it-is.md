# WHOOP there it is!

I decided to try the "[WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com)", which is a device that tracks biometrics. This post will document my journey and experience.

## Background
Recently I found myself wanting to change my habits. This is a cycle I've found myself going through every so often throughout my life, undulating between lack-of-structure and discipline. This time, I haven't been living poorly or with bad habits, so rather than "correct" myself I simply want to do better. My daily routine leaves me with little time to pursue interests or hobbies; I basically just go through the motions. And that's okay, but it's not enough.



## Day 1

Good morning! Today I woke up at ~7:11am ET. Not quite my 7am goal, but that's great! I noticed the WHOOP was vibrating on my wrist, but also my phone's alarm was going off. I'm not sure which actually woke me up -- I think the alarm. I had a passing thought that the vibration didn't seem like something that would really wake me up. Said differently: I'm not sure I could rely on it alone, without an alarm. But hey, it's Day 1. If I can really stick to these habits I'm trying to reshape then maybe it will become easier and easier.

I did "snooze" a little while. Now that I think about it, I was probably awoken at 7 which is what my first alarm is set to, then snoozed until I was able to muster the motivation to get up about 11 minutes later. Not too bad.

As I got up, I told myself to be patient because I remembered reading a review about WHOOP that it takes some time for your data to be synced before it will show up in the app. But to my surprise and delight, there was a notification waiting for me after using the bathroom: "WHOOP has officially tracked your first night of sleep. Head to the Sleep Tab for insights." Exciting!!!
