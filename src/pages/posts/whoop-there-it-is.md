# WHOOP there it is!

I decided to try the "[WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com)", which is a device that tracks biometrics. This post will document my journey and experience.

## Background
Recently I found myself wanting to change my habits. This is a cycle I've found myself going through every so often throughout my life, undulating between lack-of-structure and discipline. This time, I haven't been living poorly or with bad habits, so rather than "correct" myself I simply want to do better. My daily routine leaves me with little time to pursue interests or hobbies; I basically just go through the motions. And that's okay, but it's not enough.



## Day 1

Good morning! Today I woke up at ~7:11am ET. Not quite my 7am goal, but that's great! I noticed the WHOOP was vibrating on my wrist, but also my phone's alarm was going off. I'm not sure which actually woke me up -- I think the alarm. I had a passing thought that the vibration didn't seem like something that would really wake me up. Said differently: I'm not sure I could rely on it alone, without an alarm. But hey, it's Day 1. If I can really stick to these habits I'm trying to reshape then maybe it will become easier and easier.

I did "snooze" a little while. Now that I think about it, I was probably awoken at 7 which is what my first alarm is set to, then snoozed until I was able to muster the motivation to get up about 11 minutes later. Not too bad.

As I got up, I told myself to be patient because I remembered reading a review about WHOOP that it takes some time for your data to be synced before it will show up in the app. But to my surprise and delight, there was a notification waiting for me after using the bathroom: "WHOOP has officially tracked your first night of sleep. Head to the Sleep Tab for insights." Exciting!!!

### Evening

As I was wrapping up my work day at around 5pm ET, I got a notification for "Daily Stress Summary". Interesting! Arriving home from work, once I got settled down I checked it out. The app took me through a little guide about this section. WHOOP apparently measures stress on a scale of 0.0 - 3.0. 0 to 1 is considered low, 1 to 2 is considered medium, and 2 to 3 is considered high. The value is derived from some calculatin of heart rate measures. There's an info screen I should add a photo of.

Basically, the page has a dial with your current stress score for the day, and below that there's a chart that shows how it has changed over the course of the day.

#### Workout

Today was a workout day, so I was interested to see how this might be incorporated into WHOOP. Basically, I opened the WHOOP app and selected "Start Activity", not really knowing what it is or how it worked. Then I opened the Strong app I use for tracking workouts and got to work. Right away, I noticed a live activity for WHOOP on my phone's home screen. It kind of appeared like it was intended to track a run because there were little sections for distance and pace. But most promitent were the heart rate monitor and a little slider for the heart rate zones (1 through 5) that would move in coordination with my heart rate.

I didn't know what to make of it, but I figured it may become more clear later. Experimenting is part of the fun, so I just let it run. My workout consisted of:
- Back Squats
  - 80lbs x 10
  - 100lbs x 10
  - 120lbx x 10
  - 140lbs x 5
  - 160lbs x 5
  - 180lbs x 5
  - 180lbs x 5
  - 180lbs x 4
- Bulgarian Split Squats
  - 60lbs x 8
  - 60lbs x 8
  - 60lbx x 8
- Running - treadmill
  - 1 mile, 12:22

## Day 2

Good morning! Today I got up at 7:08am ET. The alarms went off and I was more aware of them today, but then I felt it was harder to pull myself out of bed. I definitely wanted to snooze and had the passing thought of "what do I really even need to be up for?". I'm happy that I was able to resist.

Again, used the bathroom and by the time I was finished the notification was there about my night's sleep. I love that! Today it was "You spent more time awake. You might feel more tired today, even after sufficient rest. Plan for a relaxed day or sneek in a nap to recharge."

### Reflection

_It's really interesting how using the WHOOP has already caused a shift in my mindset towards "gamifying" my biometrics. For example, I've checked my resting heart rate numerous times and have been more actively thinking about my breathing because I want to keep it low. A little silly, but an interesting observation nonetheless! I've also weighed myself and tracked my calories through another app (MyNetDiary) and seen how they automatically get integrated into WHOOP (through Apple Health I think). The question is, will I sustain this? I don't know, but for day 2 it is fun so far._
