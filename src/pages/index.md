# <span>my</span>Bio

👽👋🏻 Greetings, earthling! <small>_(my Dad would always say this)_</small>

My name is Michael but some people call me `my`.

I'm an ordinary guy living my best life with my girlfriend and our dogs Astro and Olive. We currently live in 📍Brooklyn.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer with a passion for user interfaces and user experiences. 

Currently, I work as an Engineering Manager at Major League Baseball. My team and I work across <a href="https://www.mlb.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">mlb.com</a> and <a href="https://www.milb.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">milb.com</a>. Previously, I worked at Resy on <a href="https://www.resy.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">resy.com</a>.
