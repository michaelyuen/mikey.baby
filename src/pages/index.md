# <span>my</span>Bio

👋🏻 I'm Michael but some people call me `my`. I love to create order.

I am a ~🤖 robot~, ~👽 alien~, 👨🏻‍🌾 human bean, and I live in 📍NYC.

I'm also a software engineer and I love building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GUIs</a>. Currently, I work at MLB on <a href="https://www.mlb.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">mlb.com</a>. I recently had the amazing opportunity to lead the frontend development effort of the Cheer at the Ballpark project (💀 rip). Previously, I worked at Resy on <a href="https://www.resy.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">resy.com</a>.

 Another hobby I would like take up is writing, so naturally there must be a blog! That's a big part of the motivation behind rebuilding this website, aside from it already being long overdue. To enable myself to efficiently <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn in public</a> and share what I enjoy.
