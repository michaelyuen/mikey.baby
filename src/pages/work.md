## Major League Baseball

I've worked at Major League Baseball (MLB) for over 6 years now -- the longest tenure of any job by far!

I started with MLB as a Software Engineer on the Front End Editorial Engineering Team (FEDE). This team supported web apps across the mlb.com domain; primarily those driving by editorial content such as the homepage, news apps, 


I started with MLB as a Software Engineer and have been fortunate to grow to become an Engineering Manager, where I've been leading the Minor League Baseball (MiLB) web team for the past (nearly) four years.

 The transition into a manager role is not without its challenges. For one, it's a commonly accepted fact that a lot of stellar engineers make terrible managers.

## Resy

I worked at Resy in 2018 and 2019, up to when they were acquired by American Express and leaving shortly thereafter. I worked on the Consumer Web team which essentially means [resy.com](https://www.resy.com) where most of my contributions can still be seen today -- and it remains one of my proudest achievements!

I started as a Software Engineer and was promoted to Senior Software Engineer in my second year. When I joined, I believe there was around 50 employees and I was only the third Frontend Engineer. Little did I know, I would end up being the primary contributor to the resy.com development, from the initial "Resy 3.0" redesign all the way through the release of an Algolia-powered search experience including a robust map view with facet filters and geolocation. During this time, the user base grew from ~600k monthly active users (MAU) to more than 2 million MAU.
